Alternative Approaches:

Initial idea:
Making the number a string -> not constant space

Second idea:
Reverting the number:
    -> Problem > int.Max, arithmetic overflow

Third idea: (good idea and constant space)
Reverting HALF of the number
    -> because half of the number WILL BE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NUMBER THIS WORKS
    -> for example: 1221 -> take 21 and flip it now 21 == 12
        -> Time Complexity: O(log10(n))
        -> Space Complexity: O(1)
